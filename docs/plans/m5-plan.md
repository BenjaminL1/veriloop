# M5 · v0.6 "Launch machinery" — plan

*Planned 2026-07-14 · executable-by-a-weaker-model-cold (repo §8 convention). Register:
snippet-anchored, terse, imperative — match [`fix-8-9-plan.md`](./fix-8-9-plan.md).*

**Goal:** ship veriloop's launch machinery — its own CI gate, the trust pack, the demo
repo + recorded run, the README overhaul, and the distribution fixes — so a stranger goes
from README to a working generated loop in 5 minutes (roadmap acceptance criterion 6,
[roadmap-v1.md:110-112](./roadmap-v1.md)).

**Plan-stable:** not gated on any prior milestone's outcome. Structure, checklists, and the
CI spec below are fixed now; only the ⟨execution-time⟩ fills change. Each is knowable only at
execution and carries its exact fill source:

- ⟨cmd-enumeration⟩ — the concrete safe/ask/never command list for the README "What veriloop
  runs" section. Fill from the generated `.claude/veriloop/commands.json` **at the execution
  SHA** (`node scripts/detect.mjs --repo . --out .claude/veriloop/commands.json` regenerates
  it) crossed with the scripts under
  `scripts/` that actually run. Do NOT hand-transcribe; read the file.
- ⟨comparison-facts⟩ — every cell of the README comparison table (vs `/init` · Spec Kit ·
  aider · CodeRabbit). Fill by re-verifying each competitor's current behavior at publish
  time against its primary source (roadmap §11 links, [roadmap-v1.md:368-374](./roadmap-v1.md));
  a stale cell is a BLOCKER — these move.
- ⟨benchmark-number⟩ — the mining-recovery figure, IF cited in the README. Fill from the benchmark's
  held-out gold benchmark result ([roadmap-v1.md:195-198](./roadmap-v1.md)); omit the claim
  entirely if it has not been published. Its VALUE is a deferred decision (below), not a
  plan-time fill.
- ⟨quickstart-clone-result⟩ — pass/fail of the 5-minute quickstart on a clean clone. Fill by
  actually running it on a fresh `git clone` at the execution SHA.
- ⟨checkout-pin-sha⟩ — the full commit SHA to pin `actions/checkout` at in `ci.yml`. Fill
  from `git ls-remote https://github.com/actions/checkout <tag>` at execution time; pin the
  40-char SHA, never the tag.
- ⟨setup-node-pin-sha⟩ — the full commit SHA to pin `actions/setup-node` at in `ci.yml`. Fill
  from `git ls-remote https://github.com/actions/setup-node <tag>` at execution time; pin the
  40-char SHA, never the tag.

**Deferred decisions** (CONTENT depends on a prior milestone's result — NOT in this plan):
- Whether the README cites a mining-recovery number, and its value — depends on the benchmark's
  benchmark having published ≥80% ([roadmap-v1.md:105](./roadmap-v1.md)).
- Cross-tool install adapters (superpowers precedent, [roadmap-v1.md:256-258](./roadmap-v1.md)):
  **evaluate as a listed decision, do not build.** Recorded in §6 below; no work item.

## Part 1 — veriloop's own `ci.yml` (consultation-settled 2026-07-14, BINDING — encode exactly)

### What

Add `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to the veriloop repo. Confirmed absent today (`ls
.github/workflows/` → no such directory). The compiler gets its own exit-code gate.

### The spec (do not deviate — settled by expert consultation)

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: ci
on: [push, pull_request]          # NEVER pull_request_target
permissions:
  contents: read                  # minimum; no write scopes
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: [18, 20, 22]        # matches package.json engines ">=18"
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@<checkout-pin-sha>   # ⟨checkout-pin-sha⟩ — full SHA, NOT a tag
      - uses: actions/setup-node@<setup-node-pin-sha>
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
      - run: npm test              # === node scripts/selftest.mjs (package.json:8)
```

Binding rules:
- **`npm test` only.** No build, no publish, no extra jobs. `package.json:8` is
  `"test": "node scripts/selftest.mjs"` — that is the whole gate.
- **Matrix node 18/20/22.** `package.json:6` declares `"engines": { "node": ">=18" }`.
- **`actions/checkout` (and `setup-node`) pinned by full commit SHA**, not a moving tag
  (supply-chain hardening — the repo's own drift lens would flag a tag).
- **`permissions: contents: read`.** No write scopes anywhere.
- **`on: [push, pull_request]`.** NEVER `pull_request_target` (it runs with secrets against
  untrusted fork code).
- **No `${{ github.event.* }}` interpolation inside any `run:` line** (shell-injection sink).
- **`claude plugin validate .` is NOT in this push gate.** It is a release-checklist step
  (§5), and OPTIONALLY a *separate* scheduled, non-blocking latest-CLI canary workflow — it
  must never fail a push/PR, because CLI-spec churn is not a code regression
  ([roadmap-v1.md:329](./roadmap-v1.md) names this risk).

### The self-detection side effect (record it, do it deliberately)

veriloop self-hosts ([commit `6830618`], `.claude/veriloop/veriloop-manifest.json` exists).
Its own manifest today records the test command as CI-unverified:

- `gate_commands: [{ name: "test", ci: false }]` (the `ci` field is set at
  [generate.mjs:227](../../scripts/generate.mjs) from `verified_by_ci`).
- `commands_summary.test.verified_by_ci: false` ([generate.mjs:424](../../scripts/generate.mjs)).

Adding `ci.yml` with a `run: npm test` line means the detector's CI scan
([detectors.mjs](../../scripts/lib/detectors.mjs) reconcile, via `ci.mjs`) will find `npm
test` as a CI-run command. **On the next `node scripts/generate.mjs --repo . --commands
.claude/veriloop/commands.json`, veriloop's own manifest flips those `false`→`true`.** Do
this deliberately: regenerate the self-host bundle
in the same change so the manifest tells the truth.

> **Discrepancy note (code wins):** there is NO top-level `"ci": false` boolean in the
> manifest. The flip is the per-command `gate_commands[test].ci` and
> `commands_summary.test.verified_by_ci` fields — verified `false` in the live manifest at
> this SHA. State it that way, not as a single manifest flag.

### The structural rule (restate from the selftest's ci-adopt comment block)

The self-install is **NEVER citable as adopt-path evidence.** Only `fixtures/ci-adopt/`
assertions count. This is already law in the tree — restate it verbatim in the CI PR
description and any doc that mentions the flip, quoting
[selftest.mjs:538-541](../../scripts/selftest.mjs):

> "ci-adopt is the ONLY evidence for the adopt path — never cite veriloop's own
> self-install/manifest as proof it works … a fixture supplies INPUT (a CI file); the
> assertions interrogate the detector's decision."

So: adding `ci.yml` makes veriloop's manifest *say* `ci: true`, but that manifest is NOT
proof the CI-adopt detector works — `fixtures/ci-adopt/` (asserted at
[selftest.mjs:542-622](../../scripts/selftest.mjs)) remains the sole evidence.

### How

1. Write `.github/workflows/ci.yml` per the spec above; fill ⟨checkout-pin-sha⟩ /
   ⟨setup-node-pin-sha⟩ from `git ls-remote`.
2. Regenerate the self-host bundle: `node scripts/generate.mjs --repo . --commands
   .claude/veriloop/commands.json` — confirm the manifest
   diff flips only `test`'s `ci`/`verified_by_ci` to `true` (plus `generated_at`).
3. Add a `## 0.6.x` CHANGELOG entry naming the CI addition and the deliberate self-manifest
   flip.

### Verify

- `node -e "require('js-yaml')"` is unavailable (repo is dependency-free) — instead:
  `python3 -c "import yaml,sys; d=yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/ci.yml')); assert
  d['on']==['push','pull_request']; assert d['permissions']=={'contents':'read'}; assert
  d['jobs']['test']['strategy']['matrix']['node']==[18,20,22]; print('ok')"` → prints `ok`,
  exit 0.
- `grep -n 'pull_request_target\|github.event' .github/workflows/ci.yml` → no output, exit 1
  (neither appears).
- `grep -E 'actions/checkout@[0-9a-f]{40}' .github/workflows/ci.yml` → matches (SHA-pinned),
  exit 0.
- `grep -c 'claude plugin validate' .github/workflows/ci.yml` → `0`.
- After regenerate: `python3 -c "import json; m=json.load(open('.claude/veriloop/veriloop-manifest.json'));
  assert [c for c in m['gate_commands'] if c['name']=='test'][0]['ci'] is True; print('flipped')"`
  → `flipped`, exit 0.

## Part 2 — Trust pack (checkable items)

Each item below is a checkable deliverable from the roadmap M5 trust-pack section
([roadmap-v1.md:260-267](./roadmap-v1.md)). All target the veriloop repo root / README /
SKILL.md — nothing is emitted into a target repo.

| # | Item | Verify (command → observable) |
|---|------|-------------------------------|
| T1 | README **"What veriloop runs"** section mirroring safe/ask/never tiers. The concrete command enumeration is ⟨cmd-enumeration⟩ — fill from `commands.json` + `scripts/` at exec SHA. | `grep -n 'What veriloop runs' README.md` → exit 0; section names the three tiers (safe/ask/never) matching the verify safe-list at [README.md:77](../../README.md) and [detectors.mjs:24-37](../../scripts/lib/detectors.mjs). |
| T2 | All scripts in-repo, small, readable; no `curl \| bash`, no obfuscation. | `grep -rn 'curl.*\|.*bash\|curl.*\|.*sh\b' scripts/ README.md skills/` → no output, exit 1. `wc -l scripts/*.mjs` — each human-readable; flag any >800 lines for a reader note. |
| T3 | `allowed-tools` scoping present in skill frontmatter. | `grep -n 'allowed-tools' skills/veriloop/SKILL.md` → exit 0 (add if absent — currently only `name`+`description` at [SKILL.md:2-3](../../skills/veriloop/SKILL.md)). |
| T4 | Never suggest `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. | `grep -rn 'dangerously-skip-permissions' README.md SECURITY.md skills/` → no output, exit 1. (Scope excludes `docs/`: the token legitimately appears there as a *negated* mention — [roadmap-v1.md:265](./roadmap-v1.md) "never suggest --dangerously-skip-permissions" and this plan — which are not violations of the never-SUGGEST requirement.) |
| T5 | Explicit no-exfil / no-network / no-telemetry statement. | `grep -in 'no-exfil\|no.telemetry\|no network\|does not.*network\|no telemetry' README.md SECURITY.md` → exit 0. |
| T6 | `SECURITY.md` at repo root (**absent today** — confirmed `ls SECURITY.md` fails). | `test -f SECURITY.md` → exit 0. Contents: threat model for a shell-running skill, the no-network/no-exfil pledge, how to report, the sha-pinnable-release note. |
| T7 | sha-pinnable tagged releases documented. | README install section references pinning by tag/SHA; `grep -n 'veriloop-v\|pin.*sha\|@v0' README.md SECURITY.md` → exit 0. |
| T8 | `LICENSE` file (MIT) at repo root (**absent today** — confirmed `ls LICENSE` fails, though `plugin.json:11` and `README.md:220` already say MIT). | `test -f LICENSE && grep -q 'MIT' LICENSE` → exit 0. |

> **Discrepancy note (code wins):** the repo advertises MIT (`plugin.json:11`,
> `README.md:218-220`) but ships **no `LICENSE` file and no `SECURITY.md`**. Both are real
> gaps this milestone closes — verified by `ls` at plan time.

---

## Part 3 — Distribution fixes

### D1 — SKILL.md keeps BOTH `name` + `description` frontmatter

Already true ([SKILL.md:2-3](../../skills/veriloop/SKILL.md): `name: veriloop`, `description:
>-`). Dual compat: Claude Code + `npx skills` standard. **Keep enforced** — do not drop
either key.

**Verify:** `python3 -c "import re,io; s=open('skills/veriloop/SKILL.md').read();
fm=s.split('---')[1]; assert 'name:' in fm and 'description:' in fm; print('ok')"` → `ok`.

### D2 — skill-dir naming DECIDED: keep `skills/veriloop/`

Keep `skills/veriloop/` and **accept the cosmetic `/veriloop:veriloop` plugin form.** The
standalone skill name IS the brand for `npx skills` users ([roadmap-v1.md:250-251](./roadmap-v1.md);
open decision resolved at [roadmap-v1.md:358](./roadmap-v1.md)). Document the rationale in the
README repo-layout section (near [README.md:156-170](../../README.md)) — do NOT rename the dir,
do NOT move SKILL.md to plugin root.

**Verify:** `test -d skills/veriloop` → exit 0; `grep -n 'veriloop:veriloop\|skills/veriloop'
README.md` → the rationale sentence present, exit 0.

### D3 — version lives in `plugin.json` ONLY (reconcile with the five-file selftest reality)

The roadmap says "`version` in `plugin.json` ONLY" ([roadmap-v1.md:252-253](./roadmap-v1.md)).
**The tree already contradicts a literal reading of that**, and the code wins:
[selftest.mjs:624-639](../../scripts/selftest.mjs) asserts version agreement across **five
files / six stamp values** — `VERILOOP_VERSION` (generate.mjs), `package.json`,
`plugin.json`, BOTH `marketplace.json` fields (`metadata.version` + `plugins[0].version`),
and the first `CHANGELOG.md` heading.

Reconcile, do not contradict: `plugin.json` is the **canonical/source-of-truth** stamp (it
silently wins over marketplace-entry versions at install time); the other four are
**kept in lockstep and machine-enforced** by the selftest. The M5 action is a doc/README
correction, NOT deleting stamps — deleting any stamp fails
[selftest.mjs:635-637](../../scripts/selftest.mjs).

> **Discrepancy note (code wins):** the roadmap's "plugin.json ONLY" is aspirational; the
> shipped invariant is "plugin.json is canonical, all five files agree, selftest enforces
> it." The plan adopts the code's reality. The selftest COMMENT says "five stamp locations"
> ([selftest.mjs:624](../../scripts/selftest.mjs)) while the `stamps` object holds six values
> across five files — a cosmetic wording mismatch, not a bug; leave it unless touching that
> block.

**Verify:** `npm test 2>&1 | grep 'version stamps agree'` → the assertion line present and
`0 failed` at the end.

### D4 — release tags `veriloop-vX.Y.Z`

Document the tag scheme in SECURITY.md/README (the actual tagging is M6, [NON-GOALS]).

**Verify:** `grep -n 'veriloop-vX.Y.Z\|veriloop-v0' README.md SECURITY.md` → exit 0.

### D5 — cross-tool install adapters — LISTED DECISION, not committed work

Record in §6 as a decision to evaluate (superpowers ships the same skill files into
Codex/Cursor/Copilot CLI via per-tool installers, [roadmap-v1.md:256-258](./roadmap-v1.md)).
**No implementation work item.**

---

## Part 4 — Demo assets

### DA1 — purpose-built demo repo

A tiny TS web app with **3–4 seeded defect classes the gate visibly catches** (roadmap's
recommended concept, [roadmap-v1.md:361](./roadmap-v1.md); M5 section
[roadmap-v1.md:269-273](./roadmap-v1.md)). Defect classes should map to distinct gate
signals so the recorded run shows each caught:

1. a type error (fails `typecheck` exit code),
2. a lint violation (fails `lint`),
3. a failing unit test (fails `test`),
4. (optional 4th) a constitution/lens-catchable defect (e.g. a danger-surface footgun a
   review lens flags) — demonstrates the lens layer, not just exit codes.

**How:** build it in a *separate* repo/dir, not inside veriloop (it is demo data, not
veriloop source). Reference it from the README by URL/path once it exists.

**Verify:** in the demo repo, `/veriloop` then `/dev-loop` on a change touching a seeded
defect → the gate verdict FAILs on the seeded check with the real exit code shown; the run
record names the failing unit. Concrete observable: gate output contains the failing
check name and a non-zero exit code, not an LLM "looks good."

### DA2 — asciinema/GIF of `/dev-loop` catching a real failure

Record `/dev-loop` catching a real failure at the gate (the adoption-friction gap in the
closest precedent, [roadmap-v1.md:270-271](./roadmap-v1.md)). Embed/link from the README.

**Verify:** the asset file exists and is linked from README; `grep -n 'asciinema\|\.gif\|\.cast'
README.md` → exit 0.

### DA3 — README overhaul

Methodology-first narrative + comparison table + proven 5-minute quickstart. The current
README ([README.md:1-220](../../README.md)) already leads methodology-first
("Why it's different", [README.md:20-35](../../README.md)) and has a "Five minutes to first
gate" ([README.md:56-69](../../README.md)) — **the two real gaps are the comparison table
and a clean-clone proof.**

- **Comparison table** vs `/init` · Spec Kit · aider · CodeRabbit (from the landscape,
  [roadmap-v1.md:271-273](./roadmap-v1.md)). Rows = the positioning axes at
  [roadmap-v1.md:39-55](./roadmap-v1.md): per-repo construction of the gate · code-cited
  constitution · exit-code-grounded vs LLM-as-judge · upstream/pre-PR vs PR-surface. Every
  cell is ⟨comparison-facts⟩ — re-verify at publish. **No such table exists in README today**
  (`grep -n 'CodeRabbit\|Spec Kit' README.md` → no output).
- **Claims discipline:** do NOT claim exit-code gating is novel; claim the *automated
  per-repo construction* ([roadmap-v1.md:40-42](./roadmap-v1.md)).
- Update the `## Status` block ([README.md:174-181](../../README.md)) — currently pinned at
  "v0.3.0"; bump to the M5 version and reflect launch-machinery state.

**Verify:** `grep -n 'CodeRabbit' README.md && grep -n 'Spec Kit' README.md && grep -n
'aider' README.md` → all exit 0 (table present). ⟨quickstart-clone-result⟩: in a fresh
`git clone` of the repo, follow the README quickstart end-to-end → reach a generated
`.claude/workflows/<repo>-dev-loop.js` within 5 minutes; record pass/fail.

---

## Part 5 — Stability & exit criteria

**Stable now** (fixed at plan time; a change here is a re-plan, not a fill): the CI spec
(Part 1), the trust-pack checklist (Part 2), the distribution decisions D2/D3/D5 (Part 3),
and the demo-asset structure (Part 4).

**⟨execution-time⟩ fills** (each with its source — repeated from the header for the executor):

| Fill | Source |
|------|--------|
| ⟨cmd-enumeration⟩ | `.claude/veriloop/commands.json` regenerated via `node scripts/detect.mjs --repo . --out .claude/veriloop/commands.json` + the `scripts/` that run, at exec SHA |
| ⟨comparison-facts⟩ | each competitor's primary source at publish (roadmap §11 links) |
| ⟨benchmark-number⟩ | held-out gold benchmark result IF cited; else omit |
| ⟨quickstart-clone-result⟩ | actual run on a fresh `git clone` |
| ⟨checkout-pin-sha⟩ / ⟨setup-node-pin-sha⟩ | `git ls-remote https://github.com/actions/<action> <tag>` |

**Exit criteria (mapped to v1.0 acceptance criterion 6, [roadmap-v1.md:110-112](./roadmap-v1.md)):**

1. **Trust pack complete** — T1–T8 all verify green (Part 2 table). → criterion 6 "trust
   pack + docs complete".
2. **CI live** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` merged; a push runs `npm test` green on node
   18/20/22; self-host manifest flip recorded. → criterion 6 "docs complete" + risk-register
   "compiler gets its own exit-code gate".
3. **Demo + recording** — demo repo exists with ≥3 seeded defects the gate catches; the
   asciinema/GIF is linked from README. → criterion 6 "demo repo + recorded run".
4. **5-minute quickstart proven on a clean clone** — ⟨quickstart-clone-result⟩ = pass. →
   criterion 6 "5-minute quickstart proven on a clean clone" and the M5 exit
   ([roadmap-v1.md:275-276](./roadmap-v1.md)) "a stranger can go from README to a working
   generated loop in 5 minutes".
5. **Docs synced** — README comparison table present + Status bumped; CHANGELOG entry;
   version stamps agree (`npm test` version-stamp assertion green,
   [selftest.mjs:635-637](../../scripts/selftest.mjs)).

Governance close (repo §8, [roadmap-v1.md:336-342](./roadmap-v1.md)): selftest assertion
count must not drop; append an "actual vs planned" check-off to `roadmap-v1.md` §11 when M5
lands (a later step — this plan does not edit the roadmap).

---

## Non-goals

- **The actual publish / tag / announce (M6, [roadmap-v1.md:278-288](./roadmap-v1.md)).** M5
  writes the release-checklist and documents `veriloop-vX.Y.Z`; it does NOT push tags,
  create releases, or post announcements.
- **Marketplace submissions** (`claude-plugins-community`/`-official`, Show HN, curated
  lists) — all M6.
- **Autonomy / auto-land** — post-1.0 ([roadmap-v1.md:293-304](./roadmap-v1.md)).
- **New stacks** (Rust is M4; Go/Java post-1.0). M5 adds no detector work.
- **Cross-tool install adapters** — evaluated as a decision (D5), not built.
- **`claude plugin validate .` as a push gate** — explicitly release-checklist / optional
  canary only, never in `ci.yml`'s blocking path.
- **Editing the emitted bundle, target repos, or the roadmap** — this plan writes only
  `m5-plan.md`; the CI/README/trust-pack edits are the executor's implementation step.
